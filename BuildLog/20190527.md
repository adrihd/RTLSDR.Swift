This is just my initial layout of the public interface as it is within librtlsdr.  I have removed most all of the unneeded functions that deal with device matching and enumeration as it no longer fits within the Framework itself.  I will most likely be creating a separate "manager" class which will handle the device enumeration and provide a device list to an application, which can then be used to instantiate an RTLSDR object.  Eventually as I build each method, I will change their name to fit more with the Swift coding style.

Initially, the RTLSDR class will be built with a private init() such that a class factory function will be used to create a fail-able function to determine if a USB device is an RTL or not, and instantiate and return an RTLSDR object if applicable.  How this will all end up is uncertain as of now as I am mostly concerned with being able to communicate with the RTL device over USB using IOKit, which will be my first priority.

Next up, start building up the methods needed to talk to the device using IOKit.
